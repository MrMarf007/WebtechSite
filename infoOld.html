                <p>
                    Pride and Prejudice, romantic novel by Jane Austen, published anonymously in three volumes in 1813. A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. Upon publication, Pride and Prejudice was well received by critics and readers. The first edition sold out within the first year, and it never went out of print.

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>The novel opens with one of the most famous lines in English
                        literature: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a
                        single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a
                        wife.” The statement is seemingly what Mrs. Bennet thinks as she
                        sets her sights on the newly arrived Bingley, who she is sure
                        will make a suitable husband for one of her daughters. At a
                        ball, Bingley takes an immediate interest in the beautiful and
                        shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth
                        is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each
                        other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: the
                        pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social
                        inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while the
                        pride of self-respect and prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery
                        hold Elizabeth equally aloof.</p>
                        <p>
                        The pompous Collins soon arrives, hoping to marry one of the
                        Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet steers him toward Elizabeth, but the
                        latter refuses his offer of marriage. He instead becomes engaged
                        to her friend Charlotte. During this time, Elizabeth encounters
                        the charming Wickham. There is a mutual attraction between the
                        two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his
                        inheritance.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike
                        of Darcy mounts as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging
                        Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown
                        increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and
                        vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth
                        sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A
                        surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands
                        an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley
                        and of denying Wickham his inheritance. Darcy subsequently
                        writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated
                        the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned
                        Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after
                        squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then
                        15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her
                        fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy
                        in a new light.

                        <p>
                        Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes
                        with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth,
                        since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in
                        marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters.
                        When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia,
                        offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his
                        intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the
                        encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and
                        Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth,
                        who this time accepts.

                    <h4>Review</h4>
                    <p>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is my favorite book of all time-- which isn't a phrase I throw out lightly! This book truly has the best of all worlds-- a wonderful romance, lovable characters, humor, and beautiful writing. Pride and Prejudice is the story of a young woman in the 1800's, Elizabeth Bennet. The Bennet family has five daughters, and in an age where the only thing women could do was marry rich, all the girls are pressured to find wealthy matches to secure the family's comfort. Elizabeth, however, refuses to marry the first man the comes along, and only marry when for love. She meets brooding, silent, proud and very rich Mr. Darcy, who at first has no interest in Elizabeth.</p>
                    <p>Over time, he begins to fall in love with her wit and charm. Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the last man she could ever marry, but through the course of the novel, begins to see that her prejudices towards him are fake and that he is a true gentleman who is only shy. The questions remains-- will they overcome their pride and prejudices and get married? I'm not a huge fan of 'classical classics' where the writing style is dull and hard to understand. I was so pleased to find that this is not the case with Austen's writing style. I enjoyed every single page of this wonderful novel, and truly did not want it to end! I will certainly be reading more Austen! I would recommend this book to anyone-- fans of romance, family-oriented stories, comedies, fans of classics, and even reluctant readers of classics who would like an easy gateway into the world of classic novels.</p>
