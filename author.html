                            <p>After gaining an English degree and an MA in creative writing, Katherine Orton worked for Barefoot Books in Bath before leaving to focus on her writing and her young family.</p>
                            <p>She signed with her agent after taking part in the brilliant WoMentoring Project. Katherine's debut, Nevertell, was published in 2019 to critical acclaim; Glassheart is her second novel. At the time of publishing Glassheart she lived in Bristol</p>

                    <p>My books are about the place where the real world meets the realm of imagination, ideas, folk and fairy tales. Even when the story starts in a made up land, the characters tend to find their normal lives tipped upside down by things that feel as though they've come sneaking and slipping out of dreamsâ€¦ or nightmares. </p>
                    <p>I like to twist the real and imaginary together, because that's the way I see the world. What we imagine shapes our daily lives all the time, in big ways and small. Have you ever woken up in a good or bad mood because of what you dreamt that night, and it's affected your whole day? Isn't it weird that every invention - from the lightbulb to the smartphone - started as an idea in someone's head? Our minds have made our world what it is. So what kind of world will you imagine us into?</p>
                    <p>In my books, you can expect to find magic, danger, adventure, and wonder. So if you choose to go adventuring inside any of them, here's some advice from me that might help you along the way:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Expect to encounter dangerous magic, people, landscapes, and creatures</li>
                        <li>Be prepared to run at a moments' notice</li>
                        <li>Bring snacks</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="content__text--centered">The rest, reader, is down to you.</p>
