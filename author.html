                                Jane Austen, the author of the book Pride and Prejudice, is one
                                of the most notable literary figures of all time, because her
                                stories featured romance, irony, and even social commentary. But
                                even if you've read all of her classic novels, there's a lot
                                more to know about this talented author.

                    <p>
                        Jane Austen (born December 16, 1775, Steventon, Hampshire,
                        England—died July 18, 1817, Winchester,
                        Hampshire) was an English writer who first gave the novel its
                        distinctly modern character through her
                        treatment of ordinary people in everyday life. She published four
                        novels during her lifetime: Sense and
                        Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park
                        (1814), and Emma (1815). In these and in
                        Persuasion and Northanger Abbey (published together posthumously,
                        1817), she vividly depicted English
                        middle-class life during the early 19th century. Her novels
                        defined the era’s novel of manners, but they
                        also became timeless classics that remained critical and popular
                        successes for over two centuries after her
                        death. These works reflect her enduring legacy.

                    <p>
                        The English novelist wrote about unremarkable people in
                        unremarkable situations of everyday life, and yet she
                        shaped such material into remarkable works of art. The economy,
                        precision, and wit of her prose style; the
                        shrewd, amused sympathy expressed toward her characters; and the
                        skillfulness of her characterization and
                        storytelling continue to enchant readers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jane Austen was the seventh of eight children. Her closest
                        companion throughout her life was her elder sister,
                        Cassandra. Their father was a scholar who encouraged the love of
                        learning in his children, and their mother was
                        a woman of ready wit, famed for her impromptu verses and stories.
                        The great family amusement was acting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her earliest known writings date from about 1787, and between then
                        and 1793 she wrote a large body of material that has survived in
                        three manuscript notebooks: Volume the First, Volume the Second,
                        and Volume the Third. These contain plays, verses, short novels,
                        and other prose and show Austen engaged in the parody of existing
                        literary forms, notably the genres of the sentimental novel and
                        sentimental comedy. Her passage to a more serious view of life
                        from the exuberant high spirits and extravagances of her earliest
                        writings is evident in Lady Susan, a short epistolary novel
                        written about 1793–94 (and not published until 1871). This
                        portrait of a woman bent on the exercise of her own powerful mind
                        and personality to the point of social self-destruction is, in
                        effect, a study of frustration and of woman’s fate in a society
                        that has no use for her talents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Austen was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning
                        signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable,
                        and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of
                        biographers rely on Zachary Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis
                        and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her
                        final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's
                        lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his
                        wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a
                        relapse, writing:
                        "I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought 
                        on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Austen continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied
                        with the ending of The Elliots, she rewrote the final two
                        chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817,
                        Austen began The Brothers (titled Sanditon when published in
                        1925), completing twelve chapters before stopping work in
                        mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes Sanditon's
                        heroine, Diana Parker, as an "energetic invalid". In the novel
                        Austen mocked hypochondriacs, and although she describes the
                        heroine as "bilious", five days after abandoning the novel she
                        wrote of herself that she was turning "every wrong colour" and
                        living "chiefly on the sofa". She put down her pen on 18 March
                        1817, making a note of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Austen made light of her condition, describing it as "bile" and
                        rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty
                        walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed.
                        In May, Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for
                        treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed
                        death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817 at the age of 41.
                        Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister
                        to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester
                        Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises
                        Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and
                        mentions the "extraordinary endowments of her mind", but does not
                        explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.
